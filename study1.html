<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>This report is here to introduce my hydroponic system that will grow Radishes in a DWC system. This is in order to have a foundation in growing more food for my community, which has a large amount of those in need. Though, at the start it will just be to serve me and my neighbors to ensure my system works on a smaller scale first.</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<P><strong>Background:</strong> I come a poor area in NYC, South Queens. For as long as I can remember my neighborhood is always called a "ghetto" or a low income area. With these titles also comes those who might not be fortunate enough to own a surplus of food. Everyday on my way to school from elementary to high school I would see people lined up outside of churches for rations. This isn't right from an area that has a lot of fresh markets, so it is my goal to grow food for evyerone here.</P>
<p><strong>The problem:</strong> The problem here is the lack of access to fresh food in an area with a lot of it.</p>
<P><strong>Timeine:</strong> 06/09/2025 -> present</P>
<P><strong>Budget:</strong> $500</P>

<P><strong>Factors Considered:</strong> The most important part of this system is constant maintenance. This system is a bit more manual than most, so it is very important that I always follow the Standard Operating Procedure. Even if it mean's to check up on the system twice a day, it will needed constant monitoring.</P>
<p><strong>Solution for Factors:</strong> The solution here is to not only constantly check up on my farm, but to also inform those around me to keep an eye on it, including family and neighbors. This will lower the chance of anything going wrong as mulitple people will be making sure the system is functional.</p>

<h2>Project Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>Factors that cause issues:</strong> Businesses not wanting to donate surplus food for fear it would harm profit margins</p>
<p><strong>Strengths and Weaknesses:</strong> The main strength of this project is is space. Though it is outside, it has no major pests, weather issues, or anything else that you could normally find an issue outside. The main weakness for this has to be the manual requirement. An automatic solution is possible for the water, but for other parts of the SOP it would be difficult to automate within my budget.</p>

  <p><strong>What concepts have you learned from Change Food For Goodâ€™s Intro to AgTech course that apply to your case?</strong> Being in this training has allowed me to gain more perception of my community and better planning ability. Going through the hydroponic modules would really make me think about how many around me don't have access to food that they need, and how I could possibily change that.</p>
  
  <h2>Project Milestones</h2>

<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>The greatest challenge that I had to deal with was getting my materials list ready. Though it is short I also found it hard to figure out what parts would work well with others. </p>

<h2>Solutions</h2>
<p>In order to get past this problem, I spent a lot of time researching and trying to visualize what would actually work. </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In the future, I would make the system a bit bigger. The system currently will serve it's purpose, but if it is as successful as I hope for it to be, It would be better for me to keep in mind that a system better built for expansion would be a lot more useful. If anyone wishes to duplicate my farm, my advice would be to opt for a bigger budget if possible along with making it more automatic if possible. </p>
